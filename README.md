# MadHatter

GOAL

  Use machine learning to take a person's characteristics (face, hairstyle, personality) to recommend the ideal hat for them to wear.

PROCESS

  1. Collect a large sample of images of people wearing hats from fashion websites
  2. Associate each image with a type of hat using semantic segmentation.
    
    What types of hats?
    
      - baseball cap
      - fedora
      - sun hat
      - ushanka
      - turban
      - birthday cone
      - beanie
      - conical hat
      - cowboy hat
      - top hat
      - sombrero
     
      
      
  3. Compare input with sample set, how closely does a person match with the people in the set.
  
    Method #1:
      Let AI do its magic and compare people 
    
    Method #2:
      Assign values to each image (hair color, estimated age, ethnicity, etc.) and inputted image.
      Find which type of hat is in images with values closest to that of the inputted image.
        
        What values?
    
         - skin color
         - estimated age
         - gender
         - has facial hair?
         
         
         
     Where do we get images?
